# task_manager
task_manager web application

lets build a task manager useing django admin[for v1], that contains tasks and there deadline and other stuff.\
in mvp and v0.1 we will use only django-admin due to ease of use\
then we will add frontend(ahhh, i should learn frontend)\
and lets see how far I can go


## UPDATES & IDEAS
- Task manager should rename to note manager. keeping notes ,tasks, daily notes, daily tasks, projects and related tasks, list as checklist[ like shopping list and ... ]
- Adding manifests and use k8s :)
- Notify system with email
- Assign task and users
- Add Reminder for users
- each system user can have an acount (users are linux_system_user)

## How to use:
  pass for now
  
## TODO:
- [x] set permission for users
- [ ] versoin 0.1 
- [ ] containerize manager service
## Issues:
- [ ] logout in django-jazzzmin
