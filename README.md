# task_manager
task_manager web application

lets build a task manager useing django admin[for v1], that contains tasks and there deadline and other stuff\
in mvp and v0.1 we will use only django-admin due to ease of use\
then we will add frontend(ahhh shit i should learn front)\
and lets see how far I can go


## UPDATES & IDEAS
- task manager should rename to note manager. keeping notes ,tasks, daily notes, daily tasks, projects and related tasks, list as checklist[ like shopping list and ... ]
